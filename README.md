# vanilla-gan
Have fun playing with a vanilla gan (tensorflow based)! 

# Startup
You can run `main.py` directly to view some results, or look into the `vanilla_gan.py` to search for more details. Either CNN or DNN is supported, use `model='cnn' or model='dnn'` to shift from each other. When use `'cnn'`, running on GPU is strongly recommended.

# Result Images
You can refer to `vanilla-gan\result_images` to observe the performances of this vanilla gan.
